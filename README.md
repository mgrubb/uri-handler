## Overview

This library doesn't actually provide URI handlers, instead it provides
a framework for finding URI handlers that are developed with this library
in mind.  While the public API for handling a URI is one function,
`handle-uri`, it does provide some URI utilities as well.

The underlying implementation relies on java.net.URI, however you can give the library
a URI in the form of a string, map, or java.net.URI object.  If you don't like those
options you can also extend the `uri-handler.uri.URILike` protocol.

## Usage

```clojure
(ns example
 (:require [uri-handler.core :refer (handle-uri)]))
(handle-uri "http://example.com")
(handle-uri "conf:///example/config")
(handle-uri (java.net.URI. "conf:///example/config"))
(handle-uri {:scheme "conf" :path "/example/config"})
```

## Writing URI Handlers

URI handler providers register their provider function by adding a file named *uri_handler.edn*
at the top of the classpath. *(A good place is in the resources directory)*

The contents of *uri_handler.edn* is either a map or a list of maps that describe the URI handler functions.
The supported keys are as follows (those in **bold** are required):

Key            | Value
-------------  | --------------------------------------------------------
**:scheme**    | A string that contains the type of URI this handler will process, (e.g. "http")
**:namespace** | A symbol that gives the namespace that the handler function is defined in.
**:handler**   | A symbol that names the function to call in :namespace
:description   | A string that contains a description of the URI handler
:scope         | A keyword that defines what scope this handler is in.

## Scopes

This library supports namespacing of URI handlers by way of scopes. This allows different implementations to
handle the same URI scheme without clashing. The default scope when none is given is `:global`. And example of when
one might want to use scopes is when building a library on top of uri-handler where the implementor would like to
limit the use of URI handlers to her own implementations.  See for example co.grubb/config-store. *(Not yet released)*

To use a scope to search for URI handlers, simply pass the scope as a second argument to handle-uri:

```clojure
(handle-uri "test://example.com" :example)
```

This will only look for a `"test"` handler in the `:example` scope.

## Caveats

Currently `handle-uri` will only use the first handler found on the class path for a particular scope/scheme
combination. In the future this may change to allow multiple handlers to compose, but there's not a great way
to do it, and I can't find a great use case for it either. However, I'm certainly open to adding the feature.
